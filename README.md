# Block Programming Example üß©

## Project Overview üöÄ
This project is an example of block programming, a visual and beginner-friendly way to introduce programming concepts. It demonstrates how to create a web-based block programming environment using Blockly, an open-source library that allows users to drag and drop code blocks to create programs. The project includes custom blocks and functionalities to showcase the power and versatility of block-based programming.

## Inspirations üí°
- **Blockly**: The project draws inspiration from Blockly, a powerful library developed by Google that enables the creation of block-based programming environments. Blockly is used as the core technology for creating the visual programming interface.

- **Programming Education**: The primary aim of this project is to provide an educational resource for teaching programming concepts, logic, and problem-solving to beginners, students, and enthusiasts. Block programming makes it easy for users to understand and practice programming without writing complex code.

## Features üåü
- **Custom Blocks**: The project includes custom blocks for performing various tasks, such as displaying messages, generating random numbers, and more. These custom blocks expand the functionality of the block programming environment.

- **HTTP Request Handling**: The project demonstrates how to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handle responses using custom blocks. This can serve as an introduction to web-based programming and data retrieval.

- **Chart Visualization**: Users can create bar charts based on the data generated from their Blockly programs. This feature adds a data visualization element to the learning experience.

- **Dynamic Code Execution**: The project allows users to execute their Blockly code and see the results in real-time. Users can switch between viewing text output and chart visualization as needed.

- **Custom Loops and Conditionals**: Custom loop and conditional blocks are defined, extending the capabilities of the block programming environment.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in your preferred web browser to access the block programming environment.

## Usage üíª
- Create and manipulate Blockly programs by dragging and dropping blocks.
- Click the "Execute" button to run your code.
- Switch between text output and chart visualization with the "Mostrar Gr√°fico" (Show Chart) button.
